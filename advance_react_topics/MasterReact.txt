REACT BASICS
What is React? 
React.js is a JavaScript Library use to develop Web and Mobile Applications.

What is ReactDOM?
DOM (Document Object Model) is basically an interface that represents how browser will read your HTML and XML, DOM creates a tree based structure of HTML/XML code.
ReactDOM is library which helps React to interact with DOM.

How React Works?
React converts its components and elements to native dom elements and server process them furthur same as normal websites.

React is Composable and Declaritive.
Composable means it works in components and by Declaritive means we declare things in React and library takes care of work after that. For example we define a element object using JSX.

React works in Components. Components are functions which returns React elements.

JSX - JavaScript XML : creates JS Objects or React elements. Child elements should be wrapped in a single object/element.

Components & Props in React - Functional and Class Components are there they return React Elements to render, Props are parameters which we can pass in components.
State - state of componetns its parameter values and other thing. Page got re-render when state updates. React can update state async for performace
